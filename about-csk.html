    <p>Chennai Super Kings (CSK) is an Indian professional T20 cricket franchise based in Chennai, Tamil Nadu. The team
        competes in the Indian Premier League (IPL) and was one of the eight franchises incorporated when the league was
        established in 2008. The team plays its home matches at the M. A. Chidambaram Stadium and is owned by Chennai
        Super Kings Cricket.

        The Super Kings is the joint-most successful IPL franchise, having won five IPL titles (along with Mumbai
        Indians). In the IPL, it has appeared in a 10 finals and qualified for the playoff stages 12 times, the most
        amongst the IPL teams. The franchise has also won the Champions League Twenty20 twice in 2010 and 2014. The team
        is currently captained by Ruturaj Gaikwad and coached by Stephen Fleming.

        The Super Kings was suspended for two years from the IPL starting July 2015 due to the involvement of its owners
        in the 2013 IPL betting case. The frachise re-joined the IPL for the 2018 season and won the title in its
        comeback season. In January 2022, CSK became India's first unicorn sports enterprise. As of 2022, it was the
